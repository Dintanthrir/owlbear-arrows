# Owlbear Arrows

An extension for https://www.owlbear.rodeo which draws arrows. It's very basic but solves a simple need; it adds a tool for drawing arrows in a varienty of colors and stroke widths.

_Arrows_ copies the default Owlbear color palette so drawn arrows should match other assets unless the user has heavily customized their preferred colors.

### Development

See https://docs.owlbear.rodeo/extensions/getting-started

Much like the "Custom Tool" tutorial, _Arrows_ provides a new Tool, a ToolMode filtered to be exclusive to that Tool, and a ToolAction within that ToolMode to implement a custom style picker.

### Contributing

GitHub Issues to report problems or suggest features are welcome but this isn't meant to be a large project. It does one simple thing and is considered complete as long as it does it well. Perhaps some day this can be replaced by improvements to the base Owlbear UI.

### Deployment
Hosted on Cloudflare Pages ([status page](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/)) as a static site and automatically deployed from `main`.
